# Introduction

We use the way of storing image to categorize

## Raster Image(Bitmap)

the way of Raster display :  arrays of pixels

Raster :  the most common way to store and process **image**

Advantage：has more details

Disadvantage :  when pixels of image and pixels of device are not equal, Raster is not good
- this break the direct link between image pixels and device pixels

Deal with this problem：
1. think pixels of image as a ***device-independent***
2. the device display the image with a ***approximate way***

## Vector Image

1. store shape and color
	- descripted by lines or curves
	- no reference to any particular pixel grid
2. this store the function of how to display it rather than direction display it

Advantage：***resolution independent***

Disadvantage：need to ***rasterized*** before be displayed，will lost details

***rasterized(bitmapization)*** ：Vector Image -> Raster Image

- Output
	- Display
		1. Transmissive：liquid crystal display
		2. Emissive：light-emitting diode display
	- Hardcopy
		1. Binary：ink-jet printer
		2. Continuous tone：dye sublimation printer
- Input
	1. 2D array sensor：digital camera
	2. 1D array sensor：flatbed scanner

> Transmissive：传输的
> Emissive：发射的
> Continuous tone：连续色调

## 3.1.1 Displays

- Transmissive：
	- need a light source(like *backlight*)
	- passing through the array before projected onto the screen
	- the array adjust the light's color which come from *backlight*
 
 > LCD：liquid crystal display
 
- Emissive：
	- pixel directly emit light
 
 > LED：Light-emmitting diode

## 3.1.2 Hardcopy Devices

### fundamental

if we want to show image on paper, we have different method

use pigment to reflect light(many printers can only print binary images)

ink-jet：the head moves across the paper and drops are emitted as it passed grid positions that should receive ink
 
different color：use different print heads	

### resolution

- ink-jet printer has no physical array of pixels
- the resolution is determined by size of drops and move distance

### Continuout tone 

it has a high quality
