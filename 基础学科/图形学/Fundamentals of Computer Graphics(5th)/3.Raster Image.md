We use the way of storing image to categorize

## Raster Image(Bitmap)

the way of Raster display :  arrays of pixels

Raster :  the most common way to store and process **image**

Advantage：has more details

Disadvantage :  when pixels of image and pixels of device are not equal, Raster is not good
- this break the direct link between image pixels and device pixels

Deal with this problem：
1. think pixels of image as a ***device-independent***
2. the device display the image with a ***approximate way***

## Vector Image

1. store shape and color
	- descripted by lines or curves
	- no reference to any particular pixel grid
2. this store the function of how to display it rather than direction display it

Advantage：***resolution independent***

Disadvantage：need to ***rasterized*** before be displayed，will lost details

***rasterized(bitmapization)*** ：Vector Image -> Raster Image
