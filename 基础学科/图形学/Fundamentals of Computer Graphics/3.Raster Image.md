# Introduction

We use the way of storing image to categorize

## Raster Image(Bitmap)

the way of Raster display :  arrays of pixels

Raster :  the most common way to store and process **image**

Advantage：has more details

Disadvantage :  when pixels of image and pixels of device are not equal, Raster is not good
- this break the direct link between image pixels and device pixels

Deal with this problem：
1. think pixels of image as a ***device-independent***
2. the device display the image with a ***approximate way***

## Vector Image

1. store shape and color
	- descripted by lines or curves
	- no reference to any particular pixel grid
2. this store the function of how to display it rather than direction display it

Advantage：***resolution independent***

Disadvantage：need to ***rasterized*** before be displayed，will lost details

***rasterized(bitmapization)*** ：Vector Image -> Raster Image

- Output
	- Display
		1. Transmissive：liquid crystal display
		2. Emissive：light-emitting diode display
	- Hardcopy
		1. Binary：ink-jet printer
		2. Continuous tone：dye sublimation printer
- Input
	1. 2D array sensor：digital camera
	2. 1D array sensor：flatbed scanner

> Transmissive：传输的
> Emissive：发射的
> Continuous tone：连续色调

## 3.1.1 Displays

- Transmissive：
	- need a light source(like *backlight*)
	- passing through the array before projected onto the screen
	- the array adjust the light's color which come from *backlight*
 
 > LCD：liquid crystal display
 
- Emissive：
	- pixel directly emit light
 
 > LED：Light-emmitting diode

## 3.1.2 Hardcopy Devices

### fundamental

if we want to show image on paper, we have different method

use pigment to reflect light(many printers can only print binary images)

ink-jet：the head moves across the paper and drops are emitted as it passed grid positions that should receive ink
 
different color：use different print heads	

### resolution

- ink-jet printer has no physical array of pixels
- the resolution is determined by size of drops and move distance

### Continuout tone 

it has a high quality

## 3.1.3 Iput Devices

# 3.2 Images, Pixels, and Geometry

Image: light energy in two-dimension space

function to descript an image: R^n -> V
- R: one dimension of position
	- R^2: two dimension of position
- V: the pixel's value
>R and V is a area

Raster Image and Continuous Image
1. Raster Image is discrete because it composed by pixels which is a area which has the same color
2. we make continuous image to raster image through ***sampling***
	- if a pixel value is '*t*', the vicinity's value of this pointer is '*t*'

Ruler of pixel's position：we use **integer coordinate** to descript **sample point**

## 3.2.1 Pixel Values

LDR(low dynamic range): use 8-bit to show the pixel's color
HDR(high dynamic range): use 32-bit to show the pixel's color

- 1-bit grayscale ***(1 bits per pixel)***: only show black or white, so it need high resolution to show details
- 8-bit RGB ***(24 bits per pixel)***: it has a small range to show color
- 8-bit or 10-bit RGB ***(24 or 30 bits per pixel)***: digital interfaces
- 12~14 bit RGB ***(36~42 bits per pixel)***: raw camera image
- 16 bit RGB ***(48 bits per pixel)***: professional camera image
- 16 bit grayscale ***(16 bits per pixel)***: radiology and medical image
- 16 bit half-precision float RGB: intermediate format for real-time rendering
- 32 bit float RGB: real HDR image

fixed-range and low number of bits have two problem:
1. clip: the part of exceed will be clipped
2. artifact: when we have low number of bits, we will put the value to the nearest value which we can show, this process will introduce visible jump and band image

## 3.2.2 Monitor Intensities and Gamma

people see color with nonliner, so we use Gamma to adjust the color

displayed intensity = (maximum intensity)a^γ
- a: input value
- γ: parameter

# 3.3 RGB Color
---

- we use three color and compose them to show the value of pixel
- Gamma is also fit R or G or B

# 3.4 Alpha Compositing
---

we want to use transparent pixel

c = α * c1 + (1 - α) * c2
- c1: forward color
- c2: back color
